# Biobjective pathfinding (search for Pareto-optimal solutions) ðŸ¦•

In this project we're implementing a state-of-art algorithm for
bi-objective pathfinding - BOBAâœ³ , along with some other algorithms
(BOAâœ³ and BOAâœ³enh)

The algorithms are tested on several small test instances made by hand

Benchmarking is held on big test instances (search graphs contain around 200k-400k states and 700k-1000k allowed moves between them) from [9th DIMACS Implementation Challenge](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml)

The algorithms implementations, as well as denotations are mainly
from the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11888.pdf)
